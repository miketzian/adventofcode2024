# Advent of Code 2024

It's been around 5 years since I've done any significant amount of coding in Java, so this year it seemed like it was time to see what has been added to the language of late.

This code requires Java 21+, and I'm running it with an Azul 23 JDK.

I'm also using the most recent gradle and junit (5!) libraries for build and test. I don't expect I'll hit some of junit 5's drawbacks that I see in other projects (here's hoping).

## Java features

Record classes seem useful, though have some odd restrictions - no static no-arg methods for example (or the PuzzleTimer would be one)

Cleaner -> ?

Instant -> ?
